# Cross Stitch
## Create an Express app

## Application Setup

In the terminal:
```
$ mkdir cross_stitch
$ cd cross_stitch
$ npm init
```
You can fill out the information prompted by npm init...or hit enter until it asks you "Is this okay?". Then, respond with "yes".

```
$ npm install --save express
```
The `--save` flag modifies the package.json file to include express as a dependency for our app.

```
$ touch index.js
```
